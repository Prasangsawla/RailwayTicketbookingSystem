    ```bash
    # For Linux/macOS
    ./gradlew build

    # For Windows
    .\gradlew.bat build
    ```
5.  **Run the application:**
    * **For Console/Desktop App:** Find the main class (e.g., `main()` method) within the `TrainBookingSystem` directory and run it from your IDE.
    * **For Android App:** Use Android Studio to install and run the application on an emulator or physical device.
